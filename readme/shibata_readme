 Geant4 version : geant4-09-05-patch-01
 The setup parameters for geant4.9.5 in ".bashrc" are described in 
 "/elsbeam-geant4-ver140116/readme/bashrc".

 My computer is 
 OS     : Redora Core 9
 Kernel : 2.6.25-14.fc9.i686 
    
 ===================================================
 To compile the "elsbeam-geant4"
 
 # tar -xvf elsbeam-geant4-ver140116.tar  
 # cd ./elsbeam-geant4-ver140116
 # make 
   or 
 # gmake 

 If the compile is finished.
 # cd ./sh
 # cd ./demo

 You can run the ELS simulation by "exec.sh".
 I use "tcsh", and if you use other script, please modify.

 # ./exec.sh

 About Setting parameters.

 (1) Number of primary particle.
 The default is "1".
 The parameter is "NEV" in "/elsbeam-geant4-ver140116/sh/demo/exec.sh", and you can change as you like. 
 
 (2) Other parameters.
 All of parameters are defined in "/elsbeam-geant4-ver140116/sh/demo/dat-set/setupfile-elssim.dat".
 The default condition are as follows.

   - Output files is "geant4-air-condition.dat" and "energydeposit.dat".
     --"geant4-air-condition.dat" includes condition of the air.  
     --"energydeposit.dat" includes the energy-deposit, and its position and time and so on.
        --- The position of X and Y of energy-deposit are transformed from Geant4 coordinate to
            the coordinate for TA-FD simulation. 
     -- Other files will be made, but I remove in "/elsbeam-geant4-ver140116/sh/demo/exec.sh".
     -- You can change some output file selection with "outoputfileflag_detectorplane",
        "outoputfileflag_secondparticle", "outoputfileflag_dedx" and "outoputfileflag_energydeposit".
        Some output files can be controlled in this file, and you must change is source code of 
        the simulation.

     -- Output file are made in 
        "/elsbeam-geant4-ver140116/src/SteppingVerbose.cc" 
        or "/elsbeam-geant4-ver140116/src/PrimaryGeneratorAction.cc" 
        or "/elsbeam-geant4-ver140116/src/DetectorConstruction.cc"
        
   -Incident particle is electron.
    --Parameter is "beam_particle_id"

   -The incident energy is 40MeV.
    --The energy distribution is single gaussian which mean is 40.0MeV and sigma is 0.0001MeV.
      Parameters are "beam_energy_mode" and "primary_energy".

   -The dirction is upward-going.
    --Parameters are "injection_direction_x", "injection_direction_y" and "injection_direction_z".  
       ---These values are not fluctuated.
          If you want to fluctuate the dirction, you can change the parameter values of 
          "injection_transverse_phi0_x" and "injection_transverse_phi0_y".

   -The initial position is (X,Y,Z)=(11486.2mm,-1718.2mm,2089.0mm), 
    --The origin of the coordinate is one of the edge of the ELS container.
      X-Y plane is Horizontal plane.
      Z direction is vertical.
      Please see the "ELS-geant4-01.gif" and "ELS-geant4-02.gif".

    --Parameters are "injection_position_x", "injection_position_y" and "injection_position_z".
      ---These values are not fluctuated.
         If you want to fluctuate the position, you can change the parameter values of
         "injection_position_sigma_x" and "injection_position_sigma_y".
  
   -The air composition is 
     N2  = 78.084 %
     O2  = 20.946 %
     Ar  =  0.93 %
     CO2 = 0.4 %
 
   - The weather parameters are     
     Air pressure is 1013.2472 hPa, the parameter is "air_pressure".
     Air Temperature is 20 degree-C, the parameter is "air_temperature".
     Relative humidity is 0.0%, the parameter is "air_relative_humidity".
     -- These value are not fluctuated and we can not fluctuate in this simulation.
        I desctibe the error of each value in parameter definition, however we don't use.

   - GeoMagnetic Field is ON
     -- The parameter is "geomagnetic_onoff", and filed is deinfed with
        "geomagnetic_declination", "geomagnetic_horizontal" and "geomagnetic_vertical".
     
  - No Cerenkov emission.
     -- Parameter is "cerenkov_process_flag".

   - Cut Length is 0.1mm 
     -- The parameter is "cutlenght_particle".

  These parameter are read with "/elsbeam-geant4-ver140116/src/ReadFile.cc".
  If you add new parameter, please modify it.

 The comments about source code...

 - ELS geometry parameters are calculated and defined in "/elsbeam-geant4-ver140116/src/ELSParameters.cc", 
    and "/elsbeam-geant4-ver140116/src/DetectorConstruction.cc"
   If you add "ICE" and "Detector" geometry, it is better that you modify them.

   I defined  
     - All of Beam Line components.
       No electric devices, waveguides and cables.
     - Lead blocks at vertical beam line and outside conclete blocks.
     - Cover Box 
     - Container 
     - Conclete pad for ground of ELS container.
       but No large ground plane.
           
 - Visualization is off in my code.
   I commented out of about visualization in "/elsbeam-geant4-ver140116/elsbeam-geant4.cc".
   Because my current PC can not run visualization program.
   If you want to plot of visualization, please modify it.
